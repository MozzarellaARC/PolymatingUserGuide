# ***PolymatingUserGuide***
### _A page for user instructions and manuals_

Hello, MozzarellaARC here wants to give you a quick user guide for you to use Polymating.

Before we started, I want to give you the main point of using polymating:
1. Reference object
2. Retopology Target
3. Operations

These 3 point will be explained later, for now let's take a look at the User Interface ( UI )

# _The UI_

![userInterfaceGuide1](https://github.com/MozzarellaARC/PolymatingUserGuide/assets/62471068/9da6d320-b1a3-451f-83b7-72be0e476604)

1 > Is the only Polymating button, and this button is a toggle button which you can use as a "Start" and "Stop" function for Polymating whole workflow

2 > Is a picker for the reference object you want to use for your target retopology mesh

Prety simple right, now that you know the ui. Let's take a closer look on a simple example how you can start retopology with Polymating!!

# _Reference mesh and Target mesh_

First off let's use Suzzane as a reference mesh and a random cube with subdivision as your target mesh, and create a new material to make it easier to see.

# _Material (not necessary)_

Now this is my personal material settings, you can use your own, or skip this part with wireframe overlay turn on.

# _The Wrapping_
Ok Now the next part is kinda scary but, don't be afraid. Because if you have already experience retopologizing with Shrinkwrap Modifier before, then it would look similar, the below video is how the wrapping started when you are in the state of Polymating and this is where the magic happens.

Please keep an important note that the object that you selected will be your target mesh, Polymating will automatically stopped if the target is deselected / deleted / the reference object is remove from the picker manually when Polymating is running

# The _Retopology_
Now that you have everything set, you can go to sculpt mode or edit mode whichever you prefer and then do the Retopology like this, also please pardon my retopology skill as this is just a quick show for you to understand. My actual Retopology skill is on another level hence the making of this addon xD, for this example I extensively use the sculpt grab and smooth tool :

Now this is not the only way to use Polymating, one of the other way to use it is by using it in edit mode with the "Proportional Editing" turned on. Like this :

But remember it was suppose to work with most of the Blender proprietary / primitive tool, so you could experiment with the other tool not mentioned on the guide. This guide just show which tool is mostly used by me.
_Have fun with the addon :D_

This addon is being used extensively for my other project The Rhine, which is a free model
