# PolymatingUserGuide
A page for user instructions and manuals

Hello, MozzarellaARC here wants to give you a quick user guide for you to use Polymating.

Before we started, I want to give you the main point of using polymating:
1. Reference object
2. Retopology Target
3. Operations

These 3 point will be explained later, for now let's take a look at the User Interface ( UI )

![userInterfaceGuide1](https://github.com/MozzarellaARC/PolymatingUserGuide/assets/62471068/9da6d320-b1a3-451f-83b7-72be0e476604)

1 > Is the only Polymating button, and this button is a toggle button which you can use as a "Start" and "Stop" function for Polymating whole workflow

2 > Is a picker for the reference object you want to use for your target retopology mesh

Prety simple right, now that you know the ui. Let's take a closer look on a simple example how you can start retopology with Polymating!!
